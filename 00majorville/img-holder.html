        Following the U. S. Civil War, the veterans returned home, and John Major settled with his wife Julia and daughter Anna in Northern Michigan. Dr. Arthur O’Leary, a distinctive looking man of Irish descent. He began buying up large tracts of forest and made plans to build a sawmill. Daniel Thomas and William Woodward built a dock on John Major’s property on Lake Michigan, just north of Pine Creek.
        The sawmill was built on the south side of Pine Creek not far from Lake Michigan.
        The mill was connected to the dock with an elevated roadway
        A boarding house was built south of the mill, and horse barns were built north of the creek. The town of Majorville was established. Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.
